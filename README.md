üöÄ **Highlighted Projects**:

### **1. Platforme d'Encadrement (Student Supervisor Platform)**  
A dynamic platform designed to help students select their academic supervisor and m√©moire advisor. This platform also features a rating system that allows students to give feedback on their experiences, fostering a more transparent and responsive academic environment. The goal is to bridge the gap between students and faculty, providing them with the tools to manage their academic relationships and track their progress.

### **2. IoT Local Server with ChirpStack**  
Built an IoT local server integrated with the ChirpStack open-source LoRaWAN network server. This setup allows for seamless communication between IoT devices and a centralized server. The ChirpStack integration enhances data processing and management, enabling real-time monitoring and control of connected devices, with a focus on energy efficiency and scalability.

### **3. IoT Cattle Monitoring System**  
Developed a robust IoT-based system for monitoring livestock health and mobility. The system uses a combination of sensors (MAX 30100, MLX90614, DHT22) and a Dragino LA66 LoRaWAN module for real-time data collection. Integrated with a DLOS8N gateway, this project provides farmers with valuable insights into the health, movement, and environment of their cattle, helping to optimize agricultural practices and improve animal welfare.

üìö **Interests**:

- **Data Engineering**: Constantly expanding my knowledge in data engineering through hands-on projects and free resources. I love working with data and learning how to process and analyze it to create impactful solutions.
- **Agricultural Technology**: I‚Äôm passionate about leveraging IoT and other technologies to improve agricultural practices, particularly in developing countries like Benin. My goal is to contribute to the advancement of food security and sustainability through tech innovation.

üåü **Commitments**:

- **CITA 2025**: Proudly serving on the organizing committee for the upcoming CITA 2025 conference. It‚Äôs an exciting opportunity to collaborate with other tech enthusiasts and contribute to the success of this event.
